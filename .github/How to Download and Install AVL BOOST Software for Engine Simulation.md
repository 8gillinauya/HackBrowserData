# How to Download and Install AVL BOOST Software for Engine Simulation
 
AVL BOOST is a powerful software tool that allows you to simulate the thermodynamic cycle and gas exchange of internal combustion engines. You can use it to model various engine components, such as cylinders, air cleaners, catalysts, intercoolers, turbochargers, and more. You can also perform steady-state and transient calculations, as well as combustion, emission, and acoustic analysis.

If you want to download and install AVL BOOST software for free, you need to have a valid Software Maintenance & Support contract or a University Partnership Program contract with AVL. These contracts give you access to the Self Service Portal, where you can find the latest versions of AVL simulation software and request license files.
 
To access the Self Service Portal, you need to create an account with an official email address from your company or university. You can do this by clicking on [Create Account](https://www.avl.com/en/customer-services/methodology-development-and-services-simulation-solutions/software-installation-and-licensing). After you register, you will receive an email with a link to activate your account.
 
Once you log in to the Self Service Portal, you can select the software product you want to download from the list of available products. For AVL BOOST, you can choose between different versions and operating systems. You can also download additional documentation and tutorials.
 
After you download the software installer, you need to run it on your computer and follow the instructions. You will need to specify the installation folder and accept the terms and conditions. The installation process may take some time depending on your system configuration.
 
Before you can use AVL BOOST software, you need to request a license file from the Self Service Portal. You can do this by clicking on [Request License File](https://www.avl.com/en/customer-services/methodology-development-and-services-simulation-solutions/software-installation-and-licensing). You will need to provide some information about your computer, such as the host name and the MAC address. You will receive an email with the license file attached.
 
To load the license file, you need to copy it to the folder where you installed AVL BOOST software. You can also use a license manager tool to manage your licenses. After you load the license file, you can start AVL BOOST software and enjoy its features.
 
If you have any questions or problems regarding AVL BOOST software or its installation, you can contact AVL Software Support at [software.support@avl.com](mailto:software.support@avl.com). You can also check out the online help and tutorials for more guidance.
  
AVL BOOST software is a versatile tool that can help you design and optimize your engine performance. You can use it to create realistic models of your engine and its components, and simulate various operating conditions and scenarios. You can also compare different engine configurations and evaluate their effects on fuel consumption, emissions, noise, and vibration.
 
With AVL BOOST software, you can also perform co-simulation with MATLAB and Simulink, using DLL, API, or S-functions. This allows you to integrate your engine model with other systems, such as the vehicle, the drivetrain, the ECU, or the thermal management. You can also use MATLAB and Simulink to create custom user interfaces, scripts, or functions for your simulation tasks.
 
AVL BOOST software is part of the AVL simulation solutions portfolio, which covers a wide range of applications for engine and vehicle development. You can use AVL BOOST software in combination with other AVL products, such as AVL FIRE for combustion and spray simulation, AVL EXCITE for mechanical analysis, or AVL CRUISE for vehicle system simulation. You can also benefit from the comprehensive services and support that AVL offers to its customers and partners.
